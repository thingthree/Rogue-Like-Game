Problem: teleporters do nothing, teleporters only placed for type a - type a rooms
but need to be able to be placed between either any two types of rooms or at least between 
types currently planned

solution: 

future proof: method which instantiates from prefab of types of teleporters based room type
when transitioning between rooms

quick fix: method which instantiates from prefab of types of teleporters, given the type of teleport
to instantiate and the type of room to check for transitions for
